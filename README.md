Flip Graph Generator for a Convex Polygon

Description
---
fgg is for generating flip graphs of convex n-gons. The following
image is a flip graph of the regular heptagon.  Each vertex is drawn
with a triangulation of the heptagon. Two vertices are connected by
an edge (blue line), if they are transformed from a flip operation.
fgg library is implemented by C++, and provides procedures for
preparing some stuffs used in the following image.
We have confirmed that fgg generates topological structures of
flip graphs correctly up to 15-gon.

The above image is generated by great tool
[Cytoscape](http://www.cytoscape.org/ "cytoscape").
Cytoscape allows users to construct nested network structures.
We could generate each triangulation structure (for vertex
network,) and the topology structure of a flip graph.
Then, importing all graphs on Cytoscape, and regulating layouts and
visual properties. Finally, we push the image generation button. 


Compile &amp; Install
---
We confirm fgg well-behaved at least on Mac 10.5.8 / Ubuntu 12.10,
g++ 4.0.1 and 4.6, and igraph 0.6.5. If you could not compile fgg library,
please let me know on your issue.

	$ cmake .
	$ make
	$ make install [optional]


How to use fgg
---
Documentation and comments of each function are now preparing.
We wrote simple examples using 
[the igraph library](http://igraph.sourceforge.net/ "the igraph library"),
in example directory. Now we would like to prepare small example codes for
allowing to use from python codes with swig.



Thank you!!
